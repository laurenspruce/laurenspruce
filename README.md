- 👋 Hi, I’m @laurenspruce
- 👀 I’m interested in looking for a graduate job, as I have recently graduated with first class honours in Computer Science. I am interested in Java programming and databases. I have experience within many IDEs, including Netbeans and IntelliJ IDEA. I am also used to creating mobile software within android studio.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and expanding my knowledge within Java, python and Javascript react.
